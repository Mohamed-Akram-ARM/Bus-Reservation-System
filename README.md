# Bus-Reservation-System
The Laravel Bus Reservation System is a web-based application that helps manage buses, passengers, and reservations efficiently. It allows customers to book seats online, while the admin can view, approve, or reject reservations from a user-friendly dashboard. The system integrates DataTables for easy searching, and managing large amounts of data.
